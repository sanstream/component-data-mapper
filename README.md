# data-kraai
A generic and flexible way to map any type of data into any type of component

# Inspiration
'Kraai' is the Dutch word for crow. Crows are highly resourceful and flexible creatures and can easily adapt to new situations. This flexible nature is what they share with this tool. So I named it data-kraai. Like a crow that is flexible with data. Get it?

Also crows are awesome.
